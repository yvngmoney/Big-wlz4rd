As of right now I am a systems administrator working for AFSOC as a DoD Contractor. My main thing is SCCM. I use a LOT of scripts in my daily tasks. I will be posting my scripts, that have helped me. Maybe you will find them useful or not. Also to go back and track my progression. ðŸŒ´ Here's to growth. ðŸŒ´

I'm trying to get more into a Cloud Eningeer or DevOps role.
